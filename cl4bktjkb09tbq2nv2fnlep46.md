## Habits that make a great programmer

At some point every developer wants to know how he/she can master the art of programming quickly and efficiently. It's common knowledge nothing comes easy and with that point in mind I'd like to share some of the best habits a programmer should have to be successful. when you're successful you make more money.


1. ### Create Time
*"I'll start coding tomorrow"* that's what you'll always find yourself saying and when that tomorrow arrives you still got no time. if you really want to how to program you'll free your schedule even for a short period, am sure you can learn something in 30 minutes. Create a schedule for yourself and fix those programming sessions whether its a tutorial or your doing a project those few minutes can be so handy in your development as a developer.


2. ### Be Consistent
>*"with practice we can master the art"*. Once you make the first step never stop - make sure to learn a concept of programming e.g. conditional rendering in React or Switch statements in Python, just make you learn at least one concept everyday and do it practical. if you stop you'll lose motivation and you will be back to where you were, a hopeless programmer.

3. ### Don't Rush
*"Little by little one walks far"*. Move one step at a time, start with the basics for instance, you cant start start web development then your first language to learn is React, the basic step is to start in HTML then CSS or its frameworks then finally Javascript. that's when you consider yourself worthy of learning React.

4. ### Have a mentor or a developer's community
>*"Unlike Man United, You need to work as a team"*. Find yourself a mentor-someone to guide you and show you the way. I personally didn't have a mentor I still dont but I have a developers community- twitter is big community for developers where I met great developers who inspired me, Stackoverflow, freecodecamp forum, discord, Facebook and even WhatsApp groups. This is where you share your progress and ask for help, you also offer assistance.

5. ### Always Have a plan
>*"successful people are those good at plan B"* Before you start writing code you need a well set out strategy and design. knowing how you'll handle the problem is very important,  for instance if you're developing a mobile app, you need a design of what you are building

#### In conclusion
every great developer had a habit he/she created to a pro, these are my top 5 and I'd love every beginner or experienced developers to adhere to and witness the change. my next article **I'll talk about the different career options you can pursue in computer science.**
